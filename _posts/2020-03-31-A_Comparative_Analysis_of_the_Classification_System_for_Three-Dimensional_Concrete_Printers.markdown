This study reviews and comparatively analyzes existing classification systems for 3D concrete printers to propose a classification system for 3D concrete printers. Several classifications for existing 3D printers have been proposed and used in the market. Nevertheless, quite a few of the printer types such as fused deposition modeling (FDM) and selective laser melting (SLM) are not suitable for characterizing 3D concrete printers. To derive the properties that distinguish one 3D concrete printer type from the others, this study reviews existing 3D concrete printers and comparatively analyzes the properties of 3D concrete printers identified in previous studies. The results show that existing classifications do not reflect the states-of-the-art of 3D concrete printers, the classification terms are ambiguous, and the entire printing processes are not considered. A new classification system was proposed based on the essential properties of the 3D concrete printers identified through the analysis of related work. The result of this study can be used as a basis for classifying commercial 3D concrete printers as well as studies related to 3D concrete printers.
