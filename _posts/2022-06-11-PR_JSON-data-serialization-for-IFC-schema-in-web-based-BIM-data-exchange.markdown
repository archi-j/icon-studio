## Introduction
- Building Information Modeling (BIM) and beyond
  - Rather than just adopting software applications, which simply display geometric perspectives and views of a building, or lengthy textual descriptions and spreadsheets of unstructured data, the industries have made significant progress towards the development of a robust semantic structure and a well-organized semantic connectivity map.
  - As BIM research in itself has a lot of focus on ‘information’ tends to stress on the ways in which information can be made available for addressing the core research challenges. In addition, this significant focus on information has led to increased attention on efficient usage and smooth exchange of data and information, across the various application areas in the building life-cycle.
  - IoT standards have been proposed to allow and improve communication between the multiple devices and systems available in the construction sites and offices, regardless of the system or application features.
- The advent of semantic web technologies in the AEC domain
  - Considering this high focus on combinations of information and data, it comes as no surprise that there has been an increasing interest in the use of semantic web technologies and linked data technologies. Semantic web technologies namely allow to represent information in structured graphs and efficiently integrate building information of an entirely different nature. As a result, the development of software applications that rely on multiple information sources is within reach.
    - Early articles focusing on the added value of semantic web technologies similarly see these technologies as one of the diverse sets of web technologies that can bring improvements to information exchange in the construction industry.
    - Secondly, semantic web technologies were found useful to increase the value of BIM by enabling data integration and complex search queries across several data sources.
    - With the increase of the application of sensing technology in the construction site, the third added value brought by semantic web technology is to incorporate sensing technology to manage construction document information in the field.
- Promises and expectancies
  - The primary question this article investigates is what has been and can be obtained by adopting semantic web or linked data technologies for the AEC industries.
    1. Interoperability: The usage of semantic web technologies has been considered as an opportunity to improve interoperability in the AEC industries [16–21], thus resulting in an integrated and successful data exchange environment.
    2. Linking across domains: Second, semantic web technologies provide the option to link information stemming from diverse domains (e.g. BIM, GIS, heritage, sensor data, simulation data, smart cities) into one web of linked building data.
    3. Logical inference and proofs: A third and last topic that is often used in arguing for the adoption of semantic web technologies in the architectural design and construction industry, is the underlying logical foundations of the language(s) used by semantic web technologies. An appropriate usage of the language thus allows the inference of extra information from the originally represented information.
  - It is not always clear what the difference is between “interoperability” and “linking across domains”. We consider interoperability to be the challenge to load the same content in multiple applications. Linking across domains is considered here as the challenge to combine different content that is available in multiple applications (e.g. cost data, energy simulation data, geometrical data, GIS data).
- Methodology

## Semantic web technologies
- The RDF core
- OWL semantics and OWL profiles
- Closed World Assumption (CWA) vs. Open World Assumption (OWA)
- Linked data vs. semantic web

## Aim 1: interoperability
- Interoperability standards
- A semantic alternative
- Binding parallel representations
  - Link sets
  - Mapping schemas in formal rules

## Aim 2: linking across domains

- Building performance analysis
- Regulation compliance checking
- Geographical and infrastructure data

## Aim 3: logical inference and proofs
- Regulation compliance checking
- Interoperability and model handling
- Inference processes within regular use cases

## Conclusion
- Application areas for semantic web technologies
- Key research challenges
