This lecture has been done in Black Families Technology Awareness Day 20222 organized by Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

In this lecture, students learned how the internet of things (IoT) technology had been applied in our life and its basic principles. Using the principles, participants could be able to build their own system that monitored indoor air quality and thermal comfort, and pushed notifications on their phones if its value exceeded a pre-specified threshold. Finally, several research projects from CASE were introduced, demonstrating how the IoT technology could be applied to improve our built environment.
