Hi, I'm Jihoon Chung and this is my website used for archiving studies in my spare time. I'm currently enrolled in a Ph.D. program in architectural science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and work as a graduate researcher in [Center for Architecture Science and Ecology](https://www.case.rpi.edu/). My research area is building information interoperability and natural language processing, and also I love architectural design. I'm interest in how digital fabrication creates a whole new ecology of architecture. Thank you for stopping by and I wish you all the best.

More information can be found on my [CV](https://archi-j.github.io/resume/) & [Google Scholar Page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ExZUcKYAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=2).
