Hi there, I'm Jihoon Chung and welcome to my website. This website is for archiving studies in my spare time. I'm currently enrolled as Ph.D. Student of built ecologies program at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and work as Research Assistant at [Center for Architecture Science and Ecology](https://www.case.rpi.edu/). My research area is integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, interoperability and construction 3D printing. Also, basically, I love architectural design. I'm interest in how information technology creates new system ecology of architecture & construction field. Thank you for stopping by and I wish you all the best.
