Jihoon Chung is Ph.D. Student of Built Ecology program at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and works as Research Assistant at [Center for Architecture Science and Ecology](https://www.case.rpi.edu/) (CASE), where he researches developing a building control system using Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. He holds B.Arch and M.S. in Architecture Engineering (concentration: Construction IT) from Yonsei University (Seoul, South Korea). Prior to joining, he explored a framework for technical specifications of 3D concrete printers at Building Informatics Group in Yonsei University and published several journal papers and proceedings including *Automation in Construction, ISARC: The International Association for Automation and Robotics in Construction*, and so on. Furthermore, he has experience in co-founding a startup and an organization with startup awards from the Asan Nanum Foundation (South Korea) and Yonsei University.

His research at CASE focuses on exploring a new way of identifying sources of indoor air pollutant and mitigating the air pollution by integrating BIM database and IoT sensors. In addition, his research includes developing web-based data exchange systems for dealing with building information interoperability issues using semantic web techniques.
